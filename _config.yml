summary: 'I am an aspiring Data Scientist currently based in Mountain View, California. Currently, I am working with Wireclass as a part-time data scientist, building a text classifier using a convolutional neural network to classify customer requests into different categories. 

I have worked as a data scientist intern during my graduate studies at Carnegie Mellon University, where I designed a prototype of household products recommendation engine. I was a machine learning student researcher with Strava, where I analyzed geospatial data covering cycling patterns and trends of Strava mobile application users in SanFrancisco area.

Prior to my graduate studies I worked for over 2 years of as a business data analyst where I got an opportunity to work across various cross functional teams. 

My research interests are in use of deep neural networks and artificial intelligence to make smarter products and creating rich custom experiences for users.'
