  title: New Face Generation
  link: "https://github.com/ParasChhabraCMU/DeepLearning/tree/master/Face%20Generation"
  tagline: "<p>This project involves implementing a generative adversarial networks also known as GAN's invented by Ian Goodfellow using celebrity dataset and MNIST dataset containing digit images
</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Implemented a generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces using a GPU</li>
  <li>The model uses images of celebrity faces and generates new images after training</li>
  <li>Programmed a discriminator neural network that discriminates on images as well as a generator to generate a new image</li>
